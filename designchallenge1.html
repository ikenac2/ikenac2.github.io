<h1>DESIGN CHALLENGE 1</h1>
<h2><strong>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</strong></h2>
<body>
	<p>The Line <a href="http://theline.com"><stong>The Line website</strong></a>
	</p> 
	<p>Serge Thoroval<a href="http://www.atelier-serge-thoraval.com/en/"><stong>Serge Thoroval Website</strong></a>
	</p>
<h2><strong>How do they exhibit different use of space,size, balance?</strong></h2>
<p>The Serge Thoroval website the Focal Point is in the middle, whether it is an image or text.The dark image is framed by a white negative space. This creates a minimal simplicity in the message and aesthetics to really highlight the jewelerry collection which is the purpose of the website. The problem is in the flow and user journey. Sometimes there is an overlapping of focal images, lack of obvious use of primitives, so the user is lost in the navigation, not knowing how to move from one place on the site to another, for example, not knowing how to return to homepage.</p>
<p>The Line website the Focal Point is beautiful imagery in a gridlike structure, three columns, that are used as one, two or three, depending on the content hierarchy. So a full image is used for lifestyle shots, 2 for storytelling, 3 for product display. The Negative Space is white, and frames the grid well. Because of the grid, there is a continuity to what is below the fold, depending on what content will be shown. There is also a good use of primitives, and they are positioned in exected places, top left to return to homepage for example. This creates a flow to the user journey, and the viewer begins to know what to expect and  a language is created between the website and the viewer.</p>
<h2><strong>What makes them similar and different</strong></h2>
<p>The similarities: The use of grid with a white negative space, minimalist approach, up to 3 images or text as central focal point. The differences: The Line has a purpose for use of space and balance, aided by primitives. The other website has confusing flow due to the lack of use of primitives, and no content reason for juxtaposition of images withing the grid.</p>

<p><strong>Home Page 1 shows using the grid in splits of 2 or splits of 3, in a vertical manner, with symmetric content boxes. Hierarchy is created by the size of the boxes. The negative space surrounds the boxes of content, with symmetry.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong> Home Page 2  shows using the grid horizontally. In 1 zise at the top to provide header content, creating a language. Maintaining text boxes on the right. After the 1 vertical box use, splitting the grid in 3 different size boxes on each layer, depending on inner content use. </strong>
</p>

<p><strong>Product Page 1 splits the grid in two. On the right diferrent size content boxes for text. On the left triangular box for imagery. The focal point becomes the image on the left. </strong> 
</P>
<p><strong>Product Page 2 shows the connection between Product page one and what would be below the fold in a continuity with a Homepage 1 like page.
